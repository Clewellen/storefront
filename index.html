        <h1>Welcome to Jack and Jill Vinyl!</h1>
        <p>Welcome to the website where I cautioned my friend who owns this business to keep expectations quite low.</p>
        <p>I have come to the conclusion that the HTML/CSS assignments are some sort of sick twisted joke...</p>
        <p> Seriously, if I have to build another page that resembles Frankenstein's Monster I might just get really drunk and kill the remaining brain cells that are desperately trying to retain this information.</p>
        <p>I am sure this is enough text for a sidebar; If it's not, then it will look empty...</p>
        <p>Sure, this is some weird text, but at least it isn't about cheese, right?</p>
        <p>I almost used the word "ain't" but then I would get in trouble with my wife for using that word.</p>
        <p>I can't help it that she is smarter than me, I am an idiot, plus I am listening to (old) country music so the word "ain't" has been kicking around my head.</p>
        <p> Maybe my next project will be all about the word "ain't"...and cheese. </p>
        <p>The Facebook and Instagram buttons work so if you really do want to check out their work, please do. </p>
        <p>I am so sorry Garrey, are we still friends after this site?</p>

            <div class="desc">It seems like a good segue after talking about mothers, DRINKING! (Fun fact: the word segue is Italian for follows) They can make you a fun vinyl logo and put it on a flask for you. Because when you need to sneak a drink in a public place why not do it with a flask with fun or witty sticker on it? Might add a bit of whimsy to the alcoholism. </div>
